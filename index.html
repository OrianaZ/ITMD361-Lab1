  <h3>ITMD361 Lab1 page</h3>
  <p>Hello! My name is Oriana, and I am actually a CS student who is interested in web development. Overall I hope to go into front end work in the field and actually have a part-time internship currently with this. </p>
  <p>CS does not have a specific class for this and any information so everything I have learned has been on my own. I wish to refine my skills and make sure there are no gaps in my knowledge.</p>
